## Gotchas

- For github pages to work on an [arbitrary route](https://wednesday-solutions.github.io/react-template/) we have a hack here [App/index.js](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/react-template/blob/master/app/containers/App/index.js#L43)  
   This should actually look like this 
   ```
   path={routeConfig[routeKey].route}
   ```
- Another hack for github pages to work on an [arbitrary route](https://wednesday-solutions.github.io/react-template/) we have a hack here [webpack.base](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/react-template/blob/master/internals/webpack/webpack.base.babel.js#L32)  
   This should actually be 
   ```
   publicPath: '/'
   ```
